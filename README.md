## Particle Explosion Simulation
This is an HTML and JavaScript code for a simple particle explosion simulation. The simulation is initiated by clicking the "Start" button and can be reset by clicking the "Reset" button.

## Usage
To use this simulation, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Click the "Start" button to initiate the simulation, and click the "Reset" button to reset it.

## Code Overview
The HTML code includes a title "Exercice sur l'explosion," a button to start the simulation with an ID of "startButton" and a button to reset the simulation with an ID of "resetButton". Additionally, there is an SVG tag that includes a group of circles with an ID of "boules" that will represent the particles of the explosion.

The JavaScript code initializes several variables for the simulation, including the number of particles, the coefficient of friction, the density of the particles, and the maximum radius of the particles. It also initializes arrays to store the position, velocity, radius, color, and mass of each particle.

The JavaScript code also includes functions to generate a random color, create and append circles to the SVG tag for each particle, and update the position and velocity of each particle at each time interval. The update function is called repeatedly to animate the particles.

## Customization
You can customize the simulation by changing the variables in the JavaScript code. For example, you can change the number of particles or the maximum radius of the particles to create a different type of explosion.
